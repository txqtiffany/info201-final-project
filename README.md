## Domain of Interest
Members of the _Language Lovers Team_ all have some personal association with the **Chinese language** and are interested in learning more about the learning of Chinese as a second language. We are also curious to see how the habits of second language learners reflect changing **trends** in globalization.

_Q: What other examples of data-driven projects have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?_

- [The spread of Mandarin Chinese as a global language](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305639211_The_spread_of_Mandarin_Chinese_as_a_global_language)

  - As the Chinese government promoted Mandarin Chinese and its economic power has become stronger, more foreigners have learned it as a second language. However, Mandarin Chinese still cannot replace the position the English Language is holding.


- [The effects of globalization on English language learning: Perspectives from Senegal and the United States](https://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3725&context=honors_theses)

    - This study aimed to understand how learning English as a second language affects globalization. The motivation of second language learners is communicating with English learners. Therefore, people learning Chinese as a second language may also have similar goals.


- [National K-12 Foreign Language Enrollment Survey Report by corey_c_mitchell on Scribd](http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/learning-the-language/2017/06/how_foreign_language_is_being_taught_in_us_schools.html)

  - The report showed that there is a rising trend of providing foreign language courses, such as Chinese, in U.S. high schools. Students who opt to not take these courses may find themselves at a disadvantage in the workplace.


_Q: What data-driven questions do you hope to answer and communicate about this domain (share at least 3)?_
  - How was the trend of learning Chinese been like for the past years?
  - What methods do students use to learn Chinese in a classroom setting?
  - How was the experience of non-native speaker learning Chinese?

_Q: How many features (columns) are in the data?_

A: The number of columns on the graph on page 43 is six.

_Q: What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?_

A: This specific graph answers the question “What **methods** do students use to learn Chinese in a classroom setting?” According to data presented in the graph, students often utilize making PowerPoints, doing google searches, and watching online videos.
